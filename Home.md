# Editing the wiki

Here are a some general guidelines on editing this wiki:

* **All new pages should use Markdown.**
* We are using pseudo-namespaces to organize pages.  This is accomplished by using prefixes for the page names, such as "Dev: The perfect pull request". Example prefixes are: "Dev", "Cookbook", "Install", "Roadmap", "Sprints", "IPEP", etc. **Please use appropriate prefixes for the pages you create.**
* Please add your page to one of our index pages, either this page or the index pages for one of the prefixes.
* If you find stale content, please remove it or better yet, update it.
