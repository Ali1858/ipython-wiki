# IPEP 8 - Slideshow from the notebook.

## Introduction

The aim of this IPEP is to discuss about some features of the implemented *live* slideshow_mode by @Carreau and the new *static* one pull requested by @damianavila as a part of nbconvert utilities.

As @ellisonbg suggested, there were a lot of places were the discussion was active, so I am writing this IPEP to collect all this ideas and centralized the place to think about this interesting feature.

Up to now, we have two implementation being developed to generate slideshow views from a notebook:

### *Live* slideshow

The first one has been developed by @Carreau, and I called *live* slideshow, because **is** an active notebook with a different template to provide the feel like a slideshow. To delimit each slide, the last implementation use metadata attributes for each cell.

There are several adventages and contrains about this *live* mode:

#### Adventages:

* You have a slideshow with editing capabilities and this interactivity can be useful presenting some ideas.
* Because you use metadata delimiters, you do not have to rewrite the notebook to be slideshow-friendly.
* You can put all the information you want in the slides because you have the possiblity to get this content with a lateral bar as a *normal* webpage.

#### Constrains:

* The *live* slideshow is a notebook currently communicating with one IPython server, so you need IPython to present it. This can be akward when you want to share your slideshow with someone else.
* You do not have a easy way to get a pdf view from the slideshow.
* You get a notebook style in you slides that can be great for some audience but boring for others (and all of you know that you have to get the people awake... he he).

### *Static* slideshow

The second one has been developed by @damianavila (hey, I hate talking in third person of myself... he he), and I called *static* slideshow, because this is not a notebook, it is just html + css + js parsing the notebook contents and representing them in a nice way. The last implementation is also using metadata attributes to delimit the slides. In this case, you have new_section (new horizontal slide), new_subsection (new nested/vertical slide) and new_fragment (new fragment in the current slide) - thanks to @Carrieu for support this format (derived from reveal.js library) in his metaui branch. This implementation is currently a PR for nbconvert.

#### Adventages:

* This is a *static* presentation, so you do not need IPython running to use it.
* Because you use metadata delimiters, you do not have to rewrite the notebook to be slideshow-friendly.
* You can upload as a webpage to a free host, such as github pages, dropbox, even it could be part of nbviewer
to render slideshow from uploaded ipy notebooks.
* You get all the slyling (very nice) and power (lot of plugins) of reveal.js library.
* You can also get a pdf from the slides to share and publish.

#### Contrains:

* You do not have editing in *live*, maybe necessary for some audience.
* You can not put all you want in one slide, you have a limited space to put content. If you want to put more content, you have to add another slide.
* Until now, there is no support for markdown in fragments, so inside fragments you can only put plain text (I open an issue in reveal.js proyect, I hope we can have soon this support). 

As you can see, with @Carriau and @ellisonbg we have proposed to use the same type of delimiter for the slides (metadata), so we can create a notebook to show as *live* slideshow, that can be *nbconverted* to a *static* one based in reveal without minimal (we hope, any) changes.

Ok, I have opened a issue to follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2680)

I hope you join us!

Dami√°n.
