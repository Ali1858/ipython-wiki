This page is to help us to plan and record the development meeting that the IPython team will have the week of July 22nd, 2013 at UC Berkeley.

Note that this is not meant to be an open sprint for newcomers to IPython interested in learning about the project, instead it is a technical meeting to finish up the work from the first semester and plan out the next round.  But if you are interested in participating in that kind of in-depth discussion centered on design and implementation questions, we obviously welcome your participation.

If you are interested in learning more about IPython in general, meeting the team or bringing up new ideas about the project, we will hold an 'open house' on Wednesday, 4-6pm.  Feel free to stop by at that time for snacks and fun discussions.  If you have your own projects using IPython, by all means bring a short demo for all to see, as well as any feedback you may have for us.
