This page serves to index the various IPython Enhancement Proposals that we have sed and are using to guide IPython development.  Developers are encouraged to author IPEPs for any development in IPython that the community needs to discuss *before* code is written.  Currently, our protocol for IPEPs is relatively simple.  

The IPEP author should:

1. Create a new wiki page with the title "IPEP N: Title" where "N" is the next consecutive IPEP number and "Title" is an appropriate title for the IPEP.
2. Link to that wiki page from this page.
3. Post to ipython-dev to open the IPEP for discussion.
4. Post to ipython-user to notify the larger community about the discussion on ipython-dev.
5. Discussion should continue until consensus is reached.
6. At that point, a pull request or issue should be opened to track the actual implementation.
7. The IPEP wiki page should be updated with information about the discussion and implementation.
