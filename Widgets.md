A few interesting widgets or experiments with widgets are listed here.

* [PyThreeJS](https://github.com/jovyan/pythreejs), a low-level scene-graph widget infrastructure for 3d graphics backed by [Three.js](http://threejs.org/).
* [IPyWidgets](https://github.com/jasongrout/ipywidgets), a few small widgets including a webcam widget and a javascript link widget (which evolved into https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6454)
* [Leaflet](https://github.com/ellisonbg/leaftletwidget) widget infrastructure for embedding maps, adding layers, etc.
* [Interactive protein visualization](http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2014-September/014831.html)
* Kevin Winters [demonstrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AntjkbXv1bA) some IPython widgets they are using in the Army Corp of Engineers at Sage Days in June, 2014.
* [Bootstrap Widgets](https://github.com/bollwyvl/ip-bootstrap), an in-progress collection of widgets exposing Bootstrap widgets.
* [Widget Mode](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-widgetmode), allows you to display widgets and cell outputs alone.
* [ipython-d3networkx](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-d3networkx), integration of NetworkX and D3 force directed graphs using the widget framework.
* [ipython-d3plot](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-d3plot), D3 line and stacked area plots using widgets.
* [ipython-gridwidget](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-gridwidget), widget designed to make grid layouts easy.
* [cirq](https://github.com/ntezak/cirq), widget for visually editing circuits of various domains.
* [SVG widgets](https://github.com/nworbmot/svgwidgets), widgets for drawing SVGs.
* [cookiecutter-ipython-widget](https://github.com/bollwyvl/cookiecutter-ipython-widget), a [cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for creating a pip-installable widget
* [Turtle widget](https://github.com/takluyver/mobilechelonian/tree/require-widgets)
* [ipython-flightwidgets](https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython-flightwidgets), widgets that can be used with flight control notebooks, simulators, or other flight related applications.
* [gamepad](https://github.com/jovyan/gamepad), support for the browser API to gamepads and joysticks. (This was recently integrated in the core ipywidgets library.)
* [static, persistent widgets](https://gist.github.com/danielballan/63c98b8df34a418774f2) an experiment with static, persistent widgets backed by a sqlite db. Save states explicitly, and then scroll the slider to restore history
* [bqplot](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) a plotting system for the Jupyter notebook based on ipywidgets and d3.js
