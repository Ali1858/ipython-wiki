This IPEP advances the idea of subclients.

The goal is to allow the Notebook to spawn user interfaces in separate windows, providing interfaces that are not well suited for incorporation into the Notebook UI.

For example, the Notebook might have a magic, say %edit, that takes a path to a file, then spawns an instance of a text editor, allowing users to edit the file in a new tab.
