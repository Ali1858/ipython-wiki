This IPEP advances the idea of subclients.

The goal is to allow the Notebook to spawn user interfaces in separate windows, providing interfaces that are not well suited for incorporation into the Notebook UI.

For example, the Notebook might have a magic, say %edit, that takes a path to a file, then spawns an instance of a text editor, allowing users to edit the file in a new tab.

We already have an IPEP 7.  Can you update this to the next IPEP number and add it to the index?
This is the same IPEP?? I've just changed the title.  Ahhh, OK.  Can you go through the process described here:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEPs:-IPython-Enhancement-Proposals

( open GitHub issue for discussion, etc.)

And update the title on that page?  That will help us to track progress.
