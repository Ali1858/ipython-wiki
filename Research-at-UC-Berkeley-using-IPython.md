*  Kathryn (Katy) Huff - I use IPython and the IPython notebook for everything. In particular, I use IPython and the notebook for prototyping code that contributes to my nuclear engineering research. My most recent IPython notebook uses python packages such as PyNE and yt to generate a large 3-D regular mesh of the core of the Pebble-Bed Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Nuclear Reactor. This mesh and the materials described on it will be used as input for high-fidelity neutronics simulations using external codes such as Serpent, MCNP, and MOOSE.
