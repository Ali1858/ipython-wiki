# Plans for the Fall 2014 Dev meeting at Berkeley

## Logistics

Location: we'll meet in Evans 481 ([Google maps](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Evans+Hall,+University+of+California,+Berkeley,+Berkeley,+CA+94709,+USA/@37.8736514,-122.2577944,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80857c24710a32ef:0x555901244b6a4c65)), not the same location as previous times. It's a slightly smaller room, but we should be OK.

Open House: Wednesday afternoon, 5-6:30pm.  Because of the different location, we don't have a hard cutoff like in Tolman.

## Attending

* Fernando Perez
* Brian Granger
* Min Ragan-Kelley
* Thomas Kluyver
* Paul Ivanov
* Matthias Bussonnier
* Kyle Kelley
* Jason Grout (confirm?)
* Aaron Culich

## Agenda

First, a dump of main topics. We'll organize a more detailed breakdown below.

* Release plans for 3.0 with multiuser server.
  - How much can we realistically put out in 3.0?
  - Will fully configurable auth be ready? PAM, CalNet, Stanford, LDAP, ...?
  - Text editor? Terminal? ...
  - Scope limiting exercise on multiuser UX, before we go down the rabbit hole of implementing an entire
    desktop-in-the-browser or the new Django.
* Security: multiuser server, colaboratory, remote resources, etc. 
* Static widgets.
* Notebooks as files: status/needs on nbconvert; diff & merge, etc.
* Short brainstorm session on nbviewer.
