I'm teaching a youngster the basics of Python and now have him using the notebook format. It's great for establishing a discipline and especially for exchanging ideas. In the process I find myself creating a lot of markdown cells with css styling for injecting *obvious* comments (red bg, white text). A "comment" type cell would make this much easier and have the benefit of being able to omit such cells at a later point.
