Academic labs have long had the tradition of the weekly lab meeting, where all topics of interest to the lab are discussed.  IPython is a project with very strong roots in academia, but also an open source project that needs to engage an active international community.  So while our goal with IPython is not to publish the next paper, we've been thinking about the value these regular discussions bring to how teams work on sustained efforts involving difficult problems, and wanted to bring that bit of academic practice into the open source workflow.  So we have decided to conduct weekly "lab meetings" for the IPython, that will be held publicly using a Google Hangout on Air.  

We are trying to keep the logistics simple and with a minimum of new moving parts, so the process will be simply:

* Broadcast the meeting as it happens via G+ and leave the public YouTube link afterwards.
* During the meeting, all chat that needs to happen by typing can be done on our [HipChat Dev Room](www.hipchat.com/ghtNzvmfC)
* Keep a running document with [minutes of the meeting on HackPad](https://hackpad.com/IPython-dev-meetings-6wTSjJt7TZK) where we summarize main points.  

We welcome and encourage help from others in updating these minutes during the meeting, but we'll make no major effort in ensuring that they are a detailed and accurate record of the whole discussion.  We simply don't have the time fo rthat.

Below are the videos of prior meetings, in reverse chronological order
