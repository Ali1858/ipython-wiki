    Design questions:  
    - `get_msg_cell`, `get_cell` callback - should this callback exist for all IPython notebook messages?  
    - How do we want to use require as it relates to our main.js and the IPython namespace?
    - Do width and height attribute for all of the widgets?  Should they use css?
    - Widget binding to other widgets?
    - Do we want to expose flexible box model to users in Python?
