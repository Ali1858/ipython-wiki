        self.m.reparentTo(render)

</pre>

open terminal and cd to directory where file is located, then enter following commands :
(you may want to zoom out panda window a bit so you can actually see frowney)

#  ipython
#  run file.py
#  app.m.setPos(1,1,1)
</pre>

Question: How can i improve speed of execution, from what i can see, panda is running at steady rate of 100 ms per frame. Is that tick rate of readline? Can i somehow increase that speed?
