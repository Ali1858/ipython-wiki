Scheduled: Tuesday July 8th, 5.30pm, Grand Ballroom

Nick Coghlan, a core Python developer who has [thought a lot](http://python-notes.curiousefficiency.org/en/latest/python3/) about the Python 3 transition, will be with us.

Everyone is welcome

## Ideas for discussion

- Python 3.5 will have a [matrix multiplication operator](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/) (@).
- What else do we want?
- How to use function annotations?
  - [mypy](http://www.mypy-lang.org/) experimented with optional static typing; integrate that with some kind of compilation?
- Code blocks
  - Nick is the author of [PEP 3150](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3150/) and [PEP 403](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0403/), two possible new syntaxes for this issue.
  - This is a big topic - we should be careful not to spend the whole BoF talking about it.
  - A [recent post](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2014/06/why-python-or-any-decent-language.html) arguing *against* the need for blocks in Python.
- Teaching Python 3
  - All of our core Scipy Stack packages support Python 3, though more specific tools still may not.
  - Software Carpentry is [discussing](https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/issues/107) how and when to switch to Python 3 for their workshops.
  - Some university courses (e.g. [Ethan White's](http://programmingforbiologists.org/)) are starting to switch
  - Teaching materials supporting 2&3, or maintain separate copies of materials?
  - Some students will have to go back to Python 2, because of existing code in their lab, or libraries that they need. How best to prepare them for this?
- How do we get people to switch?
