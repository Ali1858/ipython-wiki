IPython 0.11 loads user configuration from profiles.  To start configuring IPython, create the default profile:

<code>ipython profile create</code>

This will create the file <code>IPYTHON_DIR/profile_default/ipython_config.py</code>, which will have all of the default configuration commented-out.  Approximately everything you can configure in IPython will be in that file, so browsing it is really the best place to start learning about configuring IPython.

Older versions of IPython used a different configuration system, with files such as <code>IPYTHON_DIR/ipy_user_conf.py</code> or <code>IPYTHON_DIR/ipythonrc</code>.  It would be a great help if users who have done significant configuration of IPython would [[Special:Upload|upload]] their old configuration files and their equivalent <code>ipython_config.py</code>.  Users who would like help migrating to 0.11 can just post the old config and developers can help with the corresponding ipython_config.py.
