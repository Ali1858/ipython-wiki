The original issue describing this IPEP is found [here.](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1611)

Note: the final implementation of this was done in [#1732](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1732), and there are some differences in the details with the API proposed here. But by and large this document was implemented as described here.

This issue is meant to be the place to gather all feedback and discussion about [IPEP1](https://gist.github.com/fperez/2396341), a proposal to clean up the magic system and add cell-level magics. As the discussion evolves I will continue updating the [main document](https://gist.github.com/fperez/2396341), here we only keep the most current version for convenience of reading.
