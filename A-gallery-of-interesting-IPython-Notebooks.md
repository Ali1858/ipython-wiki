This page is a curated collection of IPython notebooks that are notable for some reason.  Feel free to add new content here, but please try to only include links to notebooks that include interesting visual or technical content; this should *not* simply be a dump of a Google search on every ipynb file out there.

**Important contribution instructions:** If you add new content, please ensure that for any notebook you link to, the link is to the rendered version using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.org), rather than the raw file.  Simply paste the notebook URL in the nbviewer box and copy the resulting URL of the rendered version.  This will make it much easier for visitors to be able to immediately access the new content.

Note that [Matt Davis](https://github.com/jiffyclub) has conveniently written a set of [bookmarklets and extensions](https://github.com/jiffyclub/open-in-nbviewer) to make it a one-click affair to load a Notebook URL into your browser of choice, directly opening into nbviewer.
