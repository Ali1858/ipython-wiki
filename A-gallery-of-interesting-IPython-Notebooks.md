This page is a curated collection of IPython notebooks that are notable for some reason.  Feel free to add new content here, but please try to only include links to notebooks that include interesting visual or technical content; this should *not* simply be a dump of a Google search on every ipynb file out there.

Note that Matt Davis has conveniently written a set of [bookmarklets and extensions](https://github.com/jiffyclub/open-in-nbviewer) to make it a one-click affair to load a Notebook URL into your browser of choice, directly opening into nbviewer.
